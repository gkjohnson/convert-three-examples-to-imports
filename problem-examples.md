# Remaining Problem Examples

- animation / cloth (defines variables in other script)
- camera / cinematic (relies on global camera definition. fix separately)
- gpgpu / * (GPUComputationRenderer is not exported, not on `THREE`) (some modify THREE. Fix separately)
- kinect?
- lines / colors (hilbert3D not converted)
- lines / dashed (hilbert3D not converted)
- lines / fat (hilbert3D not converted)
- loader / nodes (Node is a reserved name)
- loader / sea3d
- loader / sea3d / hierarchy
- loader / sea3d / keyframe
- loader / sea3d / morph
- loader / sea3d / physics
- loader / sea3d / skinning
- loader / sea3d / sound
- loader / x (wrapped in UMD)
- materials / compile (Node definition)
- materials / nodes (Node definition)
- _materials / video?_
- _materials / video / webcam?_
- mirror / nodes (Node definition)
- modifier / subdivision (modifies THREE object with model definitions. fix separately)
- performance / nodes (Node definition)
- postprocessing / crossfade (scenes.js relies on global THREE and is not converted)
- postprocessing / dof (using the wrong bokeh shader, should use bokeh2)
- postprocessing / nodes (Node definition)
- postprocessing / nodes / pass (Node definition)
- shaders / ocean (double underscore in shader?)
- shaders / sky (double underscore in shader)
- shadowmesh (click button) (button listener expects global function. fix separately)
- sprites / nodes (Node definition)
- _vive / paint?_
- _vive / sculpt?_
- raytracing sandbox (button refers to function in module code. fix separately)
- software / lines / splines (hilbert3D not exported)

#### Other
- Some files don't get a new line after the initial export definitions 
- Node shader code may have to be rearchitected
- Handle cases where the export is set via `[]`
