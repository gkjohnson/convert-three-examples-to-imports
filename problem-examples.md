# Remaining Problem Examples

- animation / cloth
- camera / cinematic (relies on global camera definition, fix)
- gpgpu / water (GPUComputationRenderer is not exported, not on `THREE`)
- kinect?
- lights / rectarealight (RectAreaLightsUniformsLib not converted)
- lines / fat (hilbert3D not converted)
- lines / fat / wireframe (WireframeGeometry not referenced by WireframeGeometry2)
- loader / nodes (Node is a reserved name)
- loader / sea3d
- loader / sea3d / hierarchy
- loader / sea3d / keyframe
- loader / sea3d / morph
- loader / sea3d / physics
- loader / sea3d / skinning
- loader / sea3d / sound
- loader / x (wrapped in UMD)
- materials / compile (Node definition)
- materials / nodes (Node definition)
- materials / video?
- materials / video / webcam?
- mirror / nodes (Node definition)
- modifier / subdivision (modifies THREE object with model definitions)
- multiple / elements / text (???)
- octree (not being added as import?)
- octree / raycasting (not being added as import?)
- performance / nodes (Node definition)
- postprocessing / crossfade (scenes.js relies on global THREE and is not converted)
- postprocessing / dof (using the wrong bokeh shader, should use bokeh2)
- postprocessing / nodes (Node definition)
- postprocessing / nodes / pass (Node definition)
- shaders / oceans2 (needs uniforms list??? Ocean shaders don't extend the shaderLib, wants global THREE)
- shadowmesh (click button) (button listener expects global function, fix)
- sprites / nodes (Node definition)
- video / panorama / equirectangular (not converted at all?)
- buffergeometry / constructed / from / geometry (trackball controls not made import in html)
- vive / paint?
- vive / sculpt?
- raytracing sandbox (button refers to function in module code)
- software / lines / splines (hilbert3D not exported)

#### Other
- Some files don't get a new line after the initial export definitions 
- The Node definitions are already of the import / export form but still rely on global THREE
- Handle cases where the export is set via `[]`
